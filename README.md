## NP Problem: Knapsack Problem

### Description and Application
*Find a real world problem that requires an NP algorithm to find its solution. Describe the problem and the applications of the solution; make a case of its importance.* 
A real world problem that requires an NP algorithm to find its solution is the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. The Knapsack Problem is based off a set of request items _i_ and a knapsack with a weight capacity of _W_. Each request item _i_ has a weight and a value. The goal of the Knapsack Problem is to optimize the value in the knapsack by adding items without exceeding the weight limit of the knapsack itself. A more specific and applicable real-world case of the Knapsack Problem is the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. The "0-1" part of this problem means that each item will either be wholly accepted or rejected, rather than being able to take fractions or pieces of items being added. "0" means that the item was not added to the knapsack, while "1" means that the item was added to the knapsack. As mentioned before, this problem requires an NP algorithm to find its solution. The 0-1 Knapsack Problem can be solved using dynamic programming based on the capacity of the knapsack for a heauristic solution. 

The Knapsack Problem has importance and application to anyone who is traveling or taking a bag with them to another location, particularly when flying. Whether carry-on or checked-bags, airlines have restrictions on how heavy passengers' bags can be. This can often be a problem for travelers, particularly those like myself who do not want to have to pay high fees to check bags and are trying to fit all their essentials in a single carry-on bag. The 0-1 Knapsack Problem is important for travelers, as it allows them to assign a value of importance to their items along with its weight, and the solution of this problem can tell them which items they can bring with them while traveling without going over the weight limit. This solution for the problem will save travelers time and effort, for they would have to personally lay each item they are planning on taking with them out and individually choosing which to take with them while constantly weighing their back to ensure they don't go over the weight limit. The solution would also save travelers money as they will not have to pay for a checked bag because their essentials are all in their carry-on, and they will not be charged for a bag that goes over the weight limit when being weighed before takeoff. 

For our problem, let us look at a specific real-world application of this problem. One of my friends was studying abroad in Ireland, so I decided to plan a 5 day trip to see them and sight-see in Ireland. Because my roundtrip flight was over $800 and I was planning to stay for less than a week, I wanted to only bring a carry-on with me so I could save money and not have to drag two rolling suitecases around Ireland by myself. Because I had a limited amount of space in my suitcase and British Airways has a 23kg (~50lb) carry-on weight limit, I had to pack my carry-on carefully with only the essentials. 


### Solution
*Research for a heuristic(approximate) solution of the problem, describe the solution, and implement the solution with a real world input.*
The heuristic solution for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem that I will explore is the dynamic programming solution.
